JuggleMaster


1. GENERAL

JuggleMaster is a juggling siteswap animator. It can animate any
valid siteswap, and has a large library of patterns included.

If you want to learn siteswap, check out http://www.siteswap.org/,
although it's not necessary to learn siteswap to get good use out of
this program.

JuggleMaster was originally written in C by Ken Matsuoka for DOS. It
was later ported to C++ as a platform independent library (called
jmlib) by Per Johan Groland, who also ported it to Palm OS and
Pocket PC. It was later ported to wxWidgets by Gary Briggs (which
allows it to run on a variety of platforms including Linux, Windows
and MacOS).

JuggleMaster is currently available for the following operating
systems:

MacOS, Windows, Linux   JMDlx     http://icculus.org/jugglemaster
PocketPC                JMPocket  http://jugglemaster.net
PalmOS                  JMPalm    http://jugglemaster.net (source not
                                                yet available)
Unices, DOS, Terminals  AAJM      http://icculus.org/jugglemaster/aa

The weblinks above will direct you to the proper sites to download
binaries for the various platforms. For the source code, go to
http://icculus.org/jugglemaster/

In the "docs" dir, you'll find Ken Matsuoka's original README, and
Isaac Orr's readme from the Java version (which has a better
description of how to edit the pattern files).


2. BUILDING

Build instructions and requirements vary between the different
platforms.


JMDlx

First, you need wxWidgets for your respective system, available from
http://www.wxwidgets.org.

To build on Linux or other Unix operating systems, just type
"make jmdlx" in the top-level dir. Look in the "bin" directory

To build on OSX, go into src/jmdlx and type "make osx". This will
create JuggleMaster.app.

To build on Windows using Visual Studio, extract VisualStudio.zip
where it is, and build.

If you don't have patterns.jm and semaphore.jm in the current dir when
you run it, it attempts to download them to a suitable directory (on
unices including OSX, this is $HOME/.jugglemaster. On windows, it's in
your user's Documents and Settings, to a dir called ".jugglemaster")

There are some extra features in jmdlx that aren't enabled by default
[eg mpeg videos, since they need ffmpeg]. To enable them, please edit
Makefile.cfg in the top-level dir


JMPocket

To build JMPocket you need Microsoft Embedded Visual Tools 3.0 2002
Edition, available free of charge from Microsoft's web page. JMPocket
doesn't run properly in the Pocket PC 2002 emulator, so you will also
need to download the Pocket PC 2000 SDK. The downloads can all be
found at http://download.microsoft.com

A properly configured project file is included in
src/jmpocket/JMPocket.vcw

JMPocket expects to find the pattern libary in My Documents, and it
must be named either patt_e.jm or patterns.jm.


AAJM

You'll need aalib, available from http://aa-project.sf.net.
To build, aajm uses aalib-config, so you may need the latest version of
aalib on your system [at least 1.4]

Just type "make aajm" in the top level dir.

It should build two binaries in the "bin" dir, one called "aajm" that's
all you really need. The other is called "aajm-remote" and can be used
to remotely control aajm.


JMQt

You'll need Qt, available from http://www.trolltech.com

Just type "make jmqt" in the top level dir. Look in "bin" when you're
done.
