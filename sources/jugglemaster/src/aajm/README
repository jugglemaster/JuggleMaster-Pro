AAJM README


Uhm, Right. If you haven't worked out what this is from the name, you
should seriously consider that it may not be of any interest to you.


Run it. Purty. Other things that may or may not work include:
AAOPTS="-driver slang -width 240 -height 150" \
	xterm -fn micro -geometry 240x150 -e ./aajm -s 7


This fella: http://homepage.smc.edu/kennedy_john/
and Abrash supplied the algorithms for the aa_ series of files here.


Once running, you can use the following keys:
s - change siteswap
t - change style
l - toggle load monitoring
q - quit
h - help
space - pause
+, -, enter - Speed up, down, reset
