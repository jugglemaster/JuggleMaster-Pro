<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>J2 Siteswap Generator Documentation</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><SPACER TYPE="VERTICAL" SIZE="20"><center><h3>How To Use the Siteswap Generator</h3></center>'J2' is a program to generate juggling patterns.In short, you give the program a list of parameters on the generator control panel,and then when you hit the "Generate" button it finds ALLpatterns which fit the given constraints.  Since the number of patternscan be very large, it is wise to have an idea of what kinds of patternsyou want when you ask the program to do something.<p>In this version there are 3 basic modes, or types of patterns which can befound:<dir><li>Solo asynchronous juggling ('siteswap' mode, the default)<li>Solo synchronous juggling<li>Two person passing</dir>For an explanation of the notations used in eachof these modes, refer to the <a href="notation.html">notationinstructions</a>.<p><h4>Required Settings</h4>Three parameters are required by the program -- they are listed across thetop of the siteswap control panel.  These settings specify:<p><dir><li>Number of objects juggled<li>Maximum throw value to use<li>Pattern length</dir>Obviously, as any of these numbers increases the program will take longerto run, since there are more possibilities for the computer to consider.Consider the following example settings:<p><pre>                 3 5 3     ->  A list of 3 object tricks including 441                               and 531.                 5 7 1     ->  All we get is 5, the cascade.  There                               are no other valid tricks of length 1.                 5 7 5     ->  A list containing many interesting 5                               ball patterns.</pre>In some of these runs several of the patterns printed will have portionsbefore and after, separated by spaces from the patterns themselves.  Theseare 'excited state' patterns, discussed in the<a href="notation.html">siteswap notation documentation page</a>.  The throws tothe left are starting sequences, those to the right are ending sequences.Use these throws to get in and out of the trick from the middle of acascade.  Any pattern without these throws before and after is a groundstate pattern.<p>Important: The throws in the starting/ending sequences are not parsed bythe multiplexing filter, so they may require you to make 2 simultaneouscatches from different places.  The 'excluded throws' option doesn't applyeither.  See below for explanations of these terms.<p><h4>"Mode" Options</h4>This setting simply tells the program what types of patterns you'd like it to find.Each one has its own notation, as described on the<a href="notation.html">notation page</a>.<p><h4>"Find" Options</h4>This tells the generator what class of patterns to find: Ground state patterns,excited state patterns, orboth.  The "Starting/Ending Seq." option will print starting and ending sequencesfor any excited state patterns that are found -- otherwise <code>'**'</code> isprinted to indicate an excited-state pattern.<p><h4>"Types" Options</h4>These options require some explanation.  One general point about siteswap patternsis that two which are in the same "class" (meaning that they share the same startingand ending sequences) can be strung together to get another valid pattern.  Thussince <code>441</code> is a ground-state 3-ball pattern, as is the cascade pattern<code>3</code>, they can be put together to get another valid pattern: <code>4413</code>.In this case we say that <code>4413</code> is a <i>composition</i> of <code>441</code>and <code>3</code>.<p>The other point is that you can <i>rotate</i> a pattern to get another valid one.Thus <code>441</code> can be rotated left to get <code>414</code>.  Note that<code>414</code> is not a ground-state pattern, as written, since in the followingthrow sequence:<p><pre>         .... 3333333 414 414 414 ...</pre>the last <code>3</code> lands at the same time and place as the first <code>1</code>.<p>The program doesn't list all the rotated versions of the patterns that it finds, sincethis clutters up the listings too much.  How does it decide which rotation to display?It displays the rotation which minimizes the length and throw values of the starting sequence.In the case of <code>441</code>, this minimum starting sequence length is 0 if thepattern is displayed as <code>441</code> (not <code>414</code>), so it's displayed thatway.<p>Now the three "Types" choices break down in the following way:<p><dl><dt>Default<dd>Do not show patterns which are compositions of other, <i>listed</i>, patterns.<dt>All<dd>Show all compositions.  Thus <code>4413</code> and <code>3441</code> are listed.<dt>Simple<dd>Show only "simple" patterns, which are those which are not compositions of anyshorter patterns.<p></dl>An example might clarify: Consider the pattern <code>51414</code>.  This is actuallya composition of two shorter patterns, <code>51</code> (the shower) and <code>414</code>.When "simple" is selected for this option, <code>51414</code> will not be displayedbecause it's a composition.  In the "default" setting, however, this pattern <i>will</i>be displayed because, although <code>51</code> is displayed as such by the generator,<code>414</code> will be displayed as its ground-state rotation <code>441</code>.  Ifyou were looking at a table you would see <code>51</code> and <code>441</code> withdifferent starting/ending sequences, and it wouldn't be obvious that you could rotatethe latter and tack it onto the former.  Because this is not obvious, these types ofcompositions are displayed as the default.  (Actually, in this case the generator willlist the pattern as its rotated version <code>45141</code>, since this is ground-state.)<p><h4>"Multiplexing" Options</h4>Checking this item turns on multiplexing.  By default the program does notfind multiplexing patterns; this flag allows you to do so.  The "# Allowed Throws"box sets the maximum number of throws you want any hand to make at any time; usually thiswill be 2, and very rarely more than 3.  Higher numbers slow down the program a lot.<p>Regarding the "Use Multiplexing Filter" option:When I first implemented the multiplexing option I noticedthat most of the patterns found by the computer requiredthe juggler to make 2 or more catches simultaneously withthe same hand.  This is doable if the objects come fromthe same place (a clump of 2), but it's really toughotherwise.  Therefore I added a filter which gets rid ofall multiplexing patterns which require the simultaneouscatching of objects from 2 different places (unless one ofthe caught "throws" was a hold).  It seems to be the casethat virtually no popular multiplexing patterns require thesesimultaneous catches.  Uncheck this box to eliminatethis filtering, but be prepared for some whopping lists.<p><h4>"Exclude These (self) Throws"</h4>Enter throw values here which you do not want to appear in the listed patterns.Very low throws (like <code>'3'</code>) are sometimeshard to do in a pattern containing other high ones.Excluding several throws also speeds up the program quitea bit.  Write the throw values in normal decimal form (do not use the generator's <code>10='a'</code>shorthand used in its output), with spaces between throws.  As noted above, thisexclusion doesn't apply to the starting and ending sequences.<p><h4>"Include These (self) Throws"</h4>All throw values specified here <i>must</i> be contained within each listedpattern.  Enter them as above.<p><h4>"Exclude These Passes"</h4>In two-person passing mode, exclude passes with these throw values.Again, sometimes low passes are hard to do, and this lets you get rid of them.  Thisflag has no effect when not passing.  To enter, leave out the<code>'p'</code> suffix which the generator prints.<p><h4>"Passing Communication Delay"</h4>This delay setting only has an effect when passing.  If youare doing a standard ground state passing pattern (suchas <code><3p|3p><3|3></code> for 6 objects), you and your partner canswitch into any ground state pattern instantly, with nointermediate throws.  However, many of the patterns printedwill require you both to start throwing differently atthe same time (you have to count down to the start of thepattern, to ensure synchronization).  It is nice to allowfor a communication delay, though, so that person #2 hastime to react when person #1 starts throwing a trick (manyof the popular passing tricks have this property).  This iswhat this setting determines.  The number you input is the number ofthrows after the beginning of the trick before person #2needs to throw something different from what he was whiledoing a <i>standard ground state pattern</i> (like <code><3p|3p><3|3></code>).<p>A few words need to be said about what constitutes a"standard ground state pattern".  These are those patterns whichare composed of ground state patterns of length 1.  For6 objects, for example, run the generator with the settings:(<code>number=6, max throw=4, length=1, mode=passing, find=Ground</code>).  You gettwo ground state patterns of length 1: <code><3|3></code> and <code><3p|3p></code>.Any combination of these stuck together qualifies as a"standard ground state pattern"; these include standard two-countpassing <code><3p|3p><3|3></code>, ultimate passing <code><3p|3p></code>, and so on.The delay flag lists all patterns which provide the requestedcommunication delay for at least ONEof these "standard passing patterns".  Whew, this is complicated.<p>As an example, run the generator with settings:(<code>number=6, max throw=4, length=3, mode=passing, delay=2</code>)and the list includes the two patterns:  (the guy in the left slot isthe one "leading" the tricks)<p><pre>                  <4|3p><4p|3><3|1>                        which assumes the people were doing the                        standard <3p|3p><3|3> before the trick was                        being done.  Note that person #1 has to begin                        when his partner is throwing a pass.			                        <4p|3p><4p|3p><3|1>                        which assumes the people were ultimate                        passing before starting the trick.</pre>Some of the patterns will require a 2-count passing patternto get the requested communication delay, others a 3-count,and so on.  When you use this feature just scan the listfor the patterns relevant to your case.<p>As a final example, run the generator with settings:(<code>number=6, max throw=3, length=3, mode=passing, multiplexing=on,# allowed throws=2, delay=3</code>).  One of the patterns is thepopular "left-hand single" multiplexing pattern:<code><2|3p><2p|3><[3p2]|3p></code>.  Note thatthe communication delay setting has vastly reduced the number of tricks.<p><h4>"Passing Leader Slot Number"</h4>For use with the delay setting above.  This sets the personwho is the "leader".  The default is person #1, whosethrows are printed in the left position of each <code>< | ></code>.<p></BODY></HTML>
