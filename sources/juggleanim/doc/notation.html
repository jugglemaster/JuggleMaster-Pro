<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Generalized Siteswap Notation Documentation</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><SPACER TYPE="VERTICAL" SIZE="20"><h2>Introduction</h2>This file describes the system used by the 'J2' program to notate jugglingpatterns.  For a solo asynchronous juggler, this just reduces to the popular'siteswap' notation; if you are familiar with this you can skip down to theMULTIPLEXING section below.  For additional information and help browse around at the<a href="http://www.juggling.org/help/siteswap/">JIS siteswap page</a>.You may also want to browse a<a href="http://members.directvinternet.com/~jackboyce/juggling/lodi/lodilist.html">list of good patterns</a> from a 1997 Lodi festival siteswap workshop, whichcontains some additional material on siteswap notation not covered here.<p><h2>General Idea</h2>A lot of freedom exists in choosing a notation to use for juggling.  Inparticular, there are always tradeoffs between expressiveness (how manyweird patterns like Mills Mess can you uniquely describe?) and compactness.This program uses a very 'compact' system, for two reasons:  (1) it makesthe notation more amenable to computer analysis, and (2) with less "superfluous" information in the notation it is easier for a person to lookat a pattern and figure out how to do it.<p>The main limitation of the notation used here is that it ignores allinformation concerning throwing and catching positions, as well as anycharacteristics about the objects being juggled (number of spins on clubs,etc.).  When an object is thrown, the ONLY things this notation tells youare which hand to throw to, and the amount of time until the object is caughtand thrown again.  You have complete freedom in choosing how these shouldcome about:  Make a standard throw, throw behind the back, bounce off thefloor, do a helicopter spin on your head, or whatever, so long as the objectwinds up at the right place in the right amount of time.  The notation'signorance of these throwing styles means that tricks like the 3 ball cascadeand Mills Mess are lumped together, but if you apply some creativity to theoutput of the program you can get most tricks that people do, and many thathave never been done before.<p><h2>Solo Asynchronous Juggling ('siteswap' notation)</h2>The simplest case is that of a single juggler throwing alternately withboth hands in a R-L-R-L kind of way (called 'asynchronous' juggling).This is what you do in the standard cascade pattern.  Each throw in ournotation can then be described by a single number, namely the number ofthrows in the future when the object is thrown again.  In a 3 ballcascade each throw is a <code>'3'</code>, for example.  Note that our notation doesn'tneed to specify the destination hand, since odd numbers always go to theopposite hand, even numbers to the same hand (a result of constrainingourselves to a R-L-R-L throwing rhythm).  Another way of thinking aboutit is this:  When you do a throw <code>'n'</code> (<code>n</code> is the throw number), throw justas you would if you were doing a cascade or fountain with <code>n</code> objects, atthe same handspeed.  A <code>3</code> is a short toss across, a <code>4</code>is higher and into the same hand, and so on.<p>The patterns that the program generates are just sequences of thesenumbers -- the first number describes the first throw made, the secondnumber the second throw (opposite hand as the first), and so on.  Atthe end of the pattern you loop back to the beginning and continue.<p>Valid 3 ball tricks include:<p><pre>                 3      =    standard cascade                 51     =    shower (that's 5 and 1, not fifty-one)                 42     =    two in one hand, hold with the other                 441    =    an interesting box-like pattern                 531                 55500  =    a 3-high flash</pre>The <code>'0'</code>, <code>'1'</code>, and <code>'2'</code> throws need someexplanation.  A <code>'2'</code> throw isthrown again 2 throws in the future, in other words the next throw out ofthe same hand.  Since the hand does nothing before throwing theobject again, we are free to interpret a <code>'2'</code> as just a hold for one count.A <code>'1'</code> is a fast zip across from hand to hand, as in the shower.  Finally,a <code>'0'</code> is no throw at all; the hand is empty (the pattern<code>60</code> is 3 in one hand, the other hand empty).<p>Notice that if you average the throws in each of the above patterns youalways get 3, the number of objects being juggled.  This is one of theways you can tell whether or not a string of throw numbers comprises avalid pattern.  <code>'76'</code> doesn't work, but <code>'75'</code> is avalid 6 ball pattern(commonly known as the 6 ball half-shower).  Not all strings of numberswith integer averages are valid patterns, however.<p><h3>Ground State/Excited State Patterns</h3>The siteswap patterns described in the previous section can be groupedinto two categories.  Any pattern that can be started directly from themiddle of a cascade (or fountain, for even numbers) is called a 'groundstate' pattern.  One which does not have this property is termed an'excited state' pattern.  In the list of 3 ball tricks above, all of themare ground state patterns with the exception of <code>51</code>, the shower.  To switchfrom the cascade into the shower you have to go through a series ofintermediate throws in order to avoid getting two balls in a hand at once.For the shower, a valid starting sequence of throws is <code>'52'</code> (note that thisis not a valid repeatable pattern, by the average rule).  Switching fromthe cascade to the shower and back again we could go:<p><pre>          ...33333333 52 515151...5151 2 3333333...</pre>We say that <code>'52'</code> is a valid starting sequence for the excited statesiteswap <code>51</code>, and <code>'2'</code> is a valid ending sequence (gets you backinto cascade).  The starting and ending sequences are in general not unique.<p><h3>Multiplexing</h3>If we allow 2 or more throws to be made at the same time by a single hand,the simplest way to notate it is to group together with brackets the thrownumbers of the multiplexed throws.  For example, a 5 ball ground statemultiplexed pattern is:  <code>24[54]</code>.  From the middle of a cascade (no startingsequence is needed, since this is a ground state pattern), we first do a holdwith our right hand, throw a shorter toss from the left hand to itself, andthen simultaneously throw a <code>5</code> and <code>4</code> with the right (thehand had 2 balls init, since it did the hold first).  Then we can either switch back into thecascade, or repeat the trick with a left-handed hold, etc. (since thepattern is of odd length it switches hands each repetition).  [This, by theway, is a trick that Anthony Gatto did in his act, except that he did itall while juggling over his head.  He can also do <code>26[76]</code> with 7 balls.]<p><h2>Solo Synchronous Juggler</h2>If both hands are throwing at the same time, the notation is very much likesiteswap notation above, but with two differences: (1) group together throwsmade simultaneously with parenthesis, and (2) now we need to specify adestination hand for each throw, so put an <code>'x'</code> after any throw that crossesover into the other hand (a throw without the <code>'x'</code> is assumed to be directedto the same hand that threw it).  A <code>'2'</code> is still a hold, but a <code>'2x'</code>is similar to the <code>'1'</code> in the siteswap notation above: a short pass from handto hand.  A <code>'0'</code> is still no throw, and a <code>'0x'</code> is not allowed.ALL throw numbers now must be even.<p>Examples of synchronous patterns:<p><pre>            (4,4)          = 4 ball synchronous fountain            (4x,4x)        = a common crossing version of the 4 ball fountain            (4x,2x)        = 3 ball shower with simultaneous throws            (4,2x)(2x,4)   = the 3 ball "box" or "see-saw" pattern            (6,6)(6x,2x)   = a 5 ball trick            (6x,6x)(2x,2x) = a 4 ball trick            (4,4)(4,0)     = 3 balls in 4 ball fountain (1 missing)</pre>You are free to choose which hand corresponds to which slot in theparenthesis, but your choice must remain consistent throughout a givenpattern.  Multiplexing can also be notated, exactly as above; for examplethe 4 ball pattern <code>(4,2)(2x,[44x])</code> has a multiplexed <code>'4'</code>and <code>'4x'</code>.  Lastly, the concepts of ground state/excited state patternsand starting/ending sequences are valid here as well, but now for instance the patterns<code>(4,4)</code> and <code>(4x,4x)</code> play the role that the cascade/fountaindid, since these are the 4 ball synchronous patterns of length 1.<p><h2>Two Person Passing</h2>Imagine two people juggling, each person asynchronously, but synchronizedwith respect to each other (juggler #1 throws with her right hand at thesame time juggler #2 does).  This is the situation in 6 club passing, forexample.  Now our notation has to tell BOTH people what to do, which mightsound complicated but actually isn't too bad.  Divide a "throw" into 2parts, the throwing instructions for each person.  A self-throw is writtenjust as a number, exactly as we did for siteswap notation (a <code>2</code> is a hold,a <code>3</code> is a toss to the other hand, etc.).  Append a <code>'p'</code> to a number torepresent a passed throw.  To figure out which of your partner's hands topass to, use this rule:  If without the <code>'p'</code> the throw would go to your lefthand, throw at your partner's left, and so on.<p>Some example patterns should help clarify this.  (Note the version of the average rulehere: Add up the numbers within each <code><|></code>, and average to get the numberof objects.)<p><pre>        <3p|3p><3|3>      = ordinary 6 object passing.  Notice how the                              instructions for each person are sectioned off.                              Each person starts throwing with his right.        <3p|3p>           = "ultimate" passing, where all throws are passes.        <3|3>             = two people doing 3 ball cascades (boring).        <4p|3><2|3p>      = a left-handed double, if done once from the                              middle of a "cascade" (in this case                               <3p|3p><3|3> qualifies).  This is a ground                              state trick, so no starting sequence is needed.        <2|3p><2p|3><[3p2]|3p>                          = a multiplexed pattern, the left-handed single                              (a good way to fake out your partner).  Do the                              first hold with your right hand, since that is                              when your partner is doing a '3p'.  The '2p' is                              from your left to his left, and then you                              resume.</pre>The discussion so far is actually too restrictive.  In particular, we don't need toassume that the two jugglers' right hands throw at the same time.  This is explicitlynot the case in two-count, 7 club passing -- there the right hand of juggler #1throws at the same time as the <i>left</i> hand of juggler #2 (making the passes alternate).But we can write 7 club, two-count passing as <code><4p|3><3|4p></code>, if we nowidentify the first juggler as starting with her <i>right</i> (a pass), and thesecond as starting with her <i>left</i> (a self).  The sharp reader will notice that ourrule above for figuring out which hand a pass goes to is now reversed: A <code>'4p'</code>from your right goes to your partner's <i>left</i>.<p>It may be conceptually simpler toimagine turning one of the jugglers around 180 degrees, keeping the appearance of thepattern the same -- essentially swapping her right and left hands.The jugglers now have synchronized right hands, so our originalpassing rule holds and a <code>'4p'</code> from your right hand goes to your partner'sright.  But now turn your partner back around -- you will be throwing at her left hand.<p>At any rate, keep in mind that every passing pattern in this notation can be interpreted in two ways:One with the right hands together, one with them staggered.  You might consider what the7 club, two-count <code><4p|3><3|4p></code> would be in the former point of view.</BODY></HTML>
